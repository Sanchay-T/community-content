## **The Tracks: A Story of Innovation Across Industries**

RAISE your HACK 2025 featured six visionary Industry Tracks, each a microcosm of future disruption, focused on real-world use cases. Participants didn't just solve problems; they redefined entire sectors, transforming conceptual challenges into deployable realities. Here’s a glimpse into the truly amazing applications that emerged:



* **Qualcomm Track: AI on the Edge, Right Where You Need It.** This track ignited a revolution in everyday technology, challenging teams to build Edge AI Consumer Utility Applications that run entirely on-device using the powerful Snapdragon X Elite. This bold push for on-device AI directly addressed critical real-world needs for privacy, low latency, and offline reliability, pushing AI closer to the user than ever before. Imagine an AI tutor coaching students without the internet, or a "local second brain" that indexes your private data entirely offline. One standout exemplified this by translating speech into SignWriting and Sign Animation in real-time, fully offline. This not only provided real-time communication for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community but showcased AI’s ability to bridge communication gaps directly on your device, ensuring privacy and accessibility.
* **Prosus Track: Reimagining Consumer Commerce with AI Agents.** Prosus’s track dared participants to fundamentally reinvent how consumers shop, eat, and travel through Agent-Powered E-Commerce Apps. Teams moved beyond traditional interfaces, crafting conversational shopping assistants that intelligently built reusable user profiles based on real-time dialogue, stored as dynamic knowledge graphs. This vision pushed the boundaries of personalization, creating AI agents that learn and adapt to every unique user preference, seamlessly spanning domains from retail to travel. Think about an AI-powered agent designed to rescue group trips from the dreaded group chat chaos. It takes everyone’s preferences, makes decisions, and gets the trip booked, from flights to dinner reservations, proving AI can turn complex coordination into a seamless experience.
* **Vultr Track: Architecting the Future of Work with AI Agents.** The Vultr track was a proving ground for enterprise innovation, challenging teams to harness robust cloud infrastructure and multi-agent systems to transform workplace productivity. Participants designed sophisticated AI "co-pilots" to simplify complex tasks and enhance enterprise workflows. Solutions like a cognitive assistant for field technicians, truly stood out. This real-time, multi-modal, AI multi-agent system provides clear, interactive guidance for critical tasks in industrial settings, using vision agents, command agents, and procedure agents collaborating through the Coral Protocol and powered by Groq's Llama 3 API. It’s a genuine "Future of Work" agentic workflow, transforming high-stakes operations into safer, more efficient, and fully auditable procedures. Another incredible project tackled the growing problem of hiring fraud. This AI-powered credibility checker helps hiring managers verify candidate authenticity by detecting inconsistencies across CVs, LinkedIn, GitHub, and even automated reference calls, providing crucial insights before costly hiring mistakes are made. We also saw projects like a no-code, prompt-driven AI Agent Builder that lets users generate and deploy autonomous AI agents from APIs, effectively turning apps into automations or digital workers for enterprise systems.
* **Qubic Track: Decoding Decentralized Intelligence for the Web3 Frontier.** The Qubic track bravely bridged the gap between Web3 and AI, challenging teams to Develop the Next Killer App for Qubic Mass Adoption. Focused on the unique potential of the C++-based Qubic Network, participants built powerful proofs-of-concept for cross-chain bridges, DeFi primitives, EVM interoperability, and C++ Smart Contract Audit Tools. This track unveiled cutting-edge solutions for decentralized AI compute and the future of verifiable, blockchain-powered AI services. One particularly impressive project showcased how AI can automatically identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts, categorize them by severity, and even deploy them in a controlled testing environment to build a battery of tests to verify the real impact of each vulnerability. This is a game-changer for secure and streamlined Web3 development.
* **Blackbox.ai Track: Accelerating Developer Genius with AI for Code.** BLACKBOX.AI's track empowered developers to Build Smarter and Code Faster by creating next-generation AI applications that revolutionize the development process itself. Teams leveraged the BLACKBOX.AI Coding Agent to build intelligent AI Code Assistants, proactive Developer Copilots, LLM-Powered Code Review Tools, Rapid Prototyping Tools, and innovative Automation Frameworks. This track showcased the future of developer productivity, where AI is a true co-pilot, not just a tool. One notable solution was an AI companion that helps developers grow their security skills directly within their workflow, detecting, learning, and remediating security issues in real-time during pull requests. This project showcased how AI can enhance developer security awareness and efficiency directly in the tools they use every day.
* **Conduct(or) & RAISE Track: Shaping Human-Centric Experiences & Finance with AI.** This track, powered by NativelyAI's Conductor platform, presented two impactful challenges. Teams pushed the boundaries of AI for direct human benefit by building either a Personal AI Companion to revolutionize attendee experiences at large-scale events (like RAISE Summit) or innovating Next-Gen Financial Platforms. A standout project was a comprehensive AI-powered event companion designed to elevate the experience for attendees, organizers, speakers, and sponsors alike. It offered personalized schedules, smart networking, real-time interactive features, and advanced venue navigation, demonstrating AI’s incredible role in optimizing large-scale gatherings and making them more engaging and efficient for everyone involved.
