# Arc

Arc is a purpose-built, EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain advancing the frontier of stablecoin finance and tokenization. It features USDC as native gas, deterministic settlement finality, opt-in privacy, and a stable transaction fee architecture. Optimized for stablecoin-native use cases, such as global payments, FX, and capital markets, Arc serves as a foundational settlement layer for programmable money on the internet.

## Core Architecture

**Malachite Consensus Engine**
- High-performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus
- Built on Tendermint algorithm with Rust implementation
- Sub-second deterministic finality (under 350ms with 20 validators)
- Performance up to 10,000 TPS with 4 validators
- No probabilistic confirmations or chain reorganizations

**USDC as Native Gas Token**
- Transaction fees paid directly in USDC stablecoin
- Predictable, dollar-denominated costs for enterprises
- Eliminates volatile crypto token exposure for gas payments
- Enhanced EIP-1559 fee mechanism with weighted moving averages
- Stable transaction fee architecture optimized for business use

**EVM Compatibility**
- Full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility
- Seamless migration of existing Ethereum applications
- Support for existing developer tools and frameworks
- Native integration with Solidity smart contracts

## Key Features

**Deterministic Settlement Finality**
- Transactions achieve irreversible finality in under 1 second
- No risk of chain reorganizations or reversals
- Guaranteed final settlement for enterprise applications
- Superior to probabilistic finality models

**Built-in FX Engine**
- Institutional-grade Request-for-Quote (RFQ) system
- 24/7 on-chain foreign exchange and settlement
- Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) atomic swaps
- Support for multiple stablecoin pairs (USDC, EURC, etc.)
- Perpetual futures markets for stablecoin trading

**Opt-in Privacy Controls**
- Confidential transfers hiding transaction amounts
- Addresses remain visible for compliance
- View keys for selective disclosure to regulators/auditors
- Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) implementation
- Future support for MPC, FHE, and Zero-Knowledge proofs

**MEV Mitigation**
- Classification of constructive vs. harmful MEV
- Encrypted mempools to prevent front-running
- Batch transaction processing
- Multi-proposer mechanisms for fair ordering
- Protection against sandwich attacks and value extraction

## Enterprise Integration

**Circle Platform Integration**
- Native support for Circle Payments Network (CPN)
- Full integration with USDC, EURC, and USYC tokens
- Circle Mint, Wallets, and Contracts compatibility
- Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) support
- Gateway interoperability service integration

**Real-World Asset Tokenization**
- Support for tokenized equities, bonds, and securities
- Private credit and institutional fund tokenization
- Partnership with licensed asset issuers and custodians
- Regulated real-world asset (RWA) framework
- Compliance-ready tokenization infrastructure

**Institutional Validator Network**
- Permissioned Proof-of-Authority consensus initially
- Hand-selected institutional validators
- Geographic distribution of validator nodes
- High compliance and regulatory standards
- Future transition to broader validator participation

## Use Cases

**Global Payments & Remittances**
- Cross-border payments with instant settlement
- Reduced intermediary costs and complexity
- 24/7 operation independent of banking hours
- Multi-currency stablecoin support

**Capital Markets & Trading**
- Institutional trading settlement
- Tokenized securities and derivatives
- Automated delivery-versus-payment (DvP)
- Real-time collateral management

**Foreign Exchange**
- On-chain FX trading and settlement
