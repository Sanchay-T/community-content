# Opus

Opus is the first agentic automation platform built for the enterprise. It transforms manual and fragmented workflows into AI-driven, human-supervised processes â€” combining the speed of AI with the reliability of expert oversight. Powered by AppliedAI's proprietary Large Work Model (LWM), Opus is purpose-built for enterprise processes, not consumer chat, integrating reasoning, compliance, and workflow orchestration into a single platform.

## How to stand out

- Creative use of Opus capabilities including OCR/Text Extraction, Agent/Advanced Agent, Decision nodes, Review (Human/Agentic), External Service calls to public APIs, Import/Export, and Opus Code for custom logic. Shape them to best suit your scenario.
- Clean separation of rules vs. AI judgment; thoughtful thresholds and decision-making.
- Human-in-the-loop used sparingly but effectively for risk/quality.
- Reproducibility and reliability: same inputs → same outputs.
- Final output that is action-oriented (ranked shortlist, next steps), easy to consume, and realistically time-saving.

## Workflow Examples

These examples serve real-world industry problems we have observed.

If you want, you may attempt to solve for these scenarios or design your own workflow using these as inspiration:

### Financial services — KYC/Onboarding
Intake identity docs, extract key fields, evaluate policy rules, route low-confidence cases to review, and generate a decision artifact.

### Market & social intelligence
Monitor public sources on a schedule, dedupe/cluster items, score relevance, enforce brand/policy checks, and publish a concise brief or content calendar with provenance.

### People Ops — Resume screening
Parse resumes, score against a live JD, threshold to a shortlist, and route to the right recruiter with an audit trail.

### ECommerce Returns & quality adjudication
Ingest photos/notes, assess an item's condition against policy, emit a recommendation with confidence/rationale, and escalate edge cases (e.g., high value items) to review.

### Sales — AI-assisted Personalized Demos
Ingest product docs and website, profile the lead's company and persona, score and rank demo use-cases tailored to the company and individual, support agentic vs human review, log decisions for audit, and deliver a concise brief to the rep.
