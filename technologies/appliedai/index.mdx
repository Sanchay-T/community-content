# AppliedAI

AppliedAI is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and serves clients worldwide. The organization focuses on creating innovative AI solutions that drive efficiency, enhance decision-making, and foster growth in sectors such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. Founded in London in 2021, the company relocated to Abu Dhabi in 2022 to leverage government grants and establish itself as the UAE's largest exporter of AI technology to the United States.

## Large Work Model (LWM)

AppliedAI has developed the Large Work Model (LWM), a proprietary AI model designed to handle complex enterprise processes. Unlike traditional large language models that are often optimized for consumer applications, LWM is purpose-built for business workflows, integrating reasoning, compliance, and workflow orchestration into a single platform. The LWM predicts actions rather than words, enabling it to generate structured workflows and automate critical business processes in regulated industries.
