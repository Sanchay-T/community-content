# CAMEL-AI
CAMEL-AI (Communicative Agents for Mind Exploration) is an open-source community founded in 2023, dedicated to discovering agent scaling laws through advanced multi-agent frameworks. Inspired by their landmark research paper, CAMEL enables dynamic AI societies where agents collaborate on complex tasks like synthetic data generation, task automation, and world simulations.

## Start Building with CAMEL-AI

Install the framework in seconds and explore its modular architecture:
```bash
pip install camel-ai[all]  # Full-featured installation
```

### Core Components
- **Agents**: Customizable entities with role-based specialization (e.g., Python Programmer, Stock Trader) 
- **Multi-Agent Societies**: Orchestrated teams for complex problem-solving 
- **Tool Integration**: 20+ model platforms (OpenAI, Mistral, Qwen) and 50+ external tools (GitHub, WolframAlpha) 

---

### Agentic Framework
A revolutionary architecture enabling:
- **Role-Playing Systems**: Pre-configured agent pairs for tasks like coding collaboration or customer service 
- **Memory-Augmented Conversations**: Context-aware dialogues with 4K+ token capacity 
- **Real Function Calling**: Seamless API integration for live data processing 

```python
from camel.agents import ChatAgent
from camel.models import ModelFactory

# Initialize Llama3 agent via Ollama
model = ModelFactory.create(model_platform="OLLAMA", model_type="llama3")
agent = ChatAgent("Financial Analyst", model=model)
```

### Data Generation Suite
Transform synthetic data creation with:
- **Hermes Format Generation**: Structured outputs for model training 
- **Self-Improving Pipelines**: Automated quality enhancement using reward models 
- **Math Reasoning Distillation**: Extract complex CoT data from DeepSeek R1 

**Key Features:**
- 25,000+ GPT-3.5 Turbo conversations in Domain Expert dataset 
- Support for Mistral/Unsloth fine-tuning workflows 
- Real-time data filtering through ethical guardrails
