### Nebius AI Cloud & GPU Infrastructure

Nebius provides a cloud platform purpose-built for AI/ML workloads and high-performance compute.

- **AI-native cloud platform** launched in October 2024, built from scratch to support full ML lifecycle (data preprocessing, training, fine-tuning, inference) using NVIDIA accelerated compute.  
- GPU-hardware: users can get access to NVIDIA H100, H200, L40S GPUs, the upcoming GB200 NVL72 platform, and Blackwell Ultra.  
- Scalable compute: supports large clusters, managed Kubernetes or Slurm orchestration, fast storage, interconnects (InfiniBand) etc. 
- Security & enterprise readiness: encryption, secure infrastructure, API / CLI / infrastructure-as-code tools, console UI.

### Nebius AI Studio (Inference / Model Access)

Tooling for model deployment, inference, and open-source models:

- AI Studio is Nebius’s inference service offering low-latency, cost-efficient endpoints. It supports open-source LLMs (such as Llama, Mistral, Nemo, Qwen, etc.).  
- Performance: claimed up to ~4.5× faster than competitors, with pricing up to ~50% cheaper.  
- Flexible pricing: premium / high-speed vs cost-efficient endpoints.  
- Rapid scaling: designed to go from experiment / prototype to large production workload.  

### Major Highlights & Strategic Moves

- In September 2025, Nebius signed a **US$17.4 billion** multi-year agreement with Microsoft, to provide AI infrastructure over five years; could rise to ~$19.4B depending on capacity / services.    
- Nebius is raising **US$3 billion** to accelerate growth: with $2 billion via convertible notes, $1 billion via public offering. These funds will go toward hardware, more data centers, securing land, expanding footprint.   
- Global expansion: deploying GPU clusters / data centers in UK (Blackwell Ultra GPUs), US (Vineland, New Jersey data center), Europe (Finland, France), among others.

### Additional Notes

- Nebius originated from a spinoff / restructuring of Yandex: after divesting the Russian operations under Yandex, the company refocused on international AI infrastructure.  
- It is publicly traded (Nasdaq: NBIS) and is positioning itself among competitors in AI infrastructure / “neocloud” category. 
- Competitive differentiation includes: vertical integration (hardware, data centres, software stack), open-source model support, and cost-performance trade-offs in inference.
