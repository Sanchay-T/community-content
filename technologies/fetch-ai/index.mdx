# Fetch.ai

Fetch.ai is a decentralized platform enabling the development and deployment of autonomous AI agents for real-world applications. Built with a native blockchain and integrated AI layer, Fetch.ai powers intelligent systems that can transact, learn, and optimize in complex digital and physical environments.

The platform is designed for scalability, interoperability, and autonomy, allowing developers to create self-operating agents capable of performing tasks across various domains, including finance, supply chain, energy, and smart cities. Fetch.ai leverages secure messaging, decentralized identity, and the FET token for agent transactions. With tools like the Agentverse, DeltaV, and the Fetch.ai AI Engine, it establishes the foundations for a decentralized "Internet of Things and Intelligence."
