title: "Fetch.ai"
description: "Fetch.ai is a decentralized platform for building and running autonomous AI agents on a purpose-built blockchain. Through services such as Agentverse, DeltaV, and the Fetch Network, developers can deploy agents that negotiate, learn, and transact in complex digital and physical environments, all secured by the FET token."

# Fetch.ai

[Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai) is an open-access blockchain-and-AI stack that lets anyone create **autonomous software agents** capable of making decisions, exchanging value, and collaborating without human micromanagement. Founded by **Humayun Sheikh, Toby Simpson, and Thomas Hain** in 2019, the project pairs an agent runtime (the *uAgents* framework) with a [Cosmos-SDK–based ledger](https://network.fetch.ai/docs/introduction/ledger/ledger-intro), on-chain identity, micropayments in **FET**, and a growing suite of developer tools—laying the groundwork for a truly decentralized “Internet of Agents.”

## Core Features

- **uAgents Framework** – Build lightweight *Autonomous Economic Agents* with the [Python SDK](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents), capable of on-chain and off-chain interactions.  
- **Agentverse** – A cloud IDE & marketplace for hosting and monetizing agents; explore the docs at [docs.agentverse.ai](https://docs.agentverse.ai/docs).  
- **DeltaV Chat Interface** – A conversational gateway where users can talk to agents via natural language; see the intro blog “[Welcome to DeltaV](https://fetch.ai/blog/Welcome-to-DeltaV).”  
- **Fetch Ledger** – Secure consensus, smart contracts, and FET-denominated fees on the [main network](https://network.fetch.ai/docs/introduction/ledger/ledger-intro).  
- **Almanac Contract** – An on-chain registry that lets agents publish metadata and be discovered; details in the [Almanac docs](https://network.fetch.ai/docs/introduction/almanac/introduction).

Fetch.ai continues to expand its toolkit and partnerships, positioning autonomous agents as a practical layer for decentralized AI across finance, mobility, energy, supply chain, and beyond. To start building, dive into the [Agentverse docs](https://docs.agentverse.ai/docs) or clone examples from the [Fetch.ai GitHub](https://github.com/fetchai)—then deploy and monetize agents directly on the Fetch Network.
