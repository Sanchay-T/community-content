## 🚀 Introducing Gemini

**Demis Hassabis**, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind, describes Gemini as the culmination of decades of research in AI and neuroscience — merging **reasoning**, **multimodality**, and **efficiency**.  
Gemini builds upon the strengths of DeepMind's scientific foundations, combining large-scale data learning with human-aligned problem-solving.

> “Our goal with Gemini has always been to create models that are helpful, safe, and capable of reasoning deeply across modalities.” — *Demis Hassabis*

## ✨ Key Highlights

### 🧩 Multimodal by Design
Gemini understands and reasons across **text, images, audio, video, and code**, processing them in a unified context.

### ⚙️ Model Variants
- **Gemini Ultra** — Largest and most capable, designed for cutting-edge research and enterprise workloads.  
- **Gemini Pro** — High-capability model for general-purpose reasoning and creation.  
- **Gemini Flash / Flash-Lite** — Optimized for speed and cost-efficiency; ideal for high-throughput or edge deployments.  
- **Gemini Nano** — Runs locally on devices like the Pixel 8 Pro; enables on-device intelligence.  
- **Gemini Computer Use** — Experimental model with agentic ability to interact with UIs, perform multi-step actions, and control applications.

### 🧠 Reasoning & “Deep Think” Mode
The **Gemini 2.5** generation introduced **Deep Think**, a deliberative reasoning mode allowing the model to explore multiple hypotheses before producing a response — an early step toward “thinking” AI.

### 🔍 Leading Benchmarks
Gemini models top performance across key evaluations in:
- **Math and science reasoning**
- **Coding and logic tasks**
- **Long-context understanding**
- **Multimodal comprehension**

### ⚡ Efficiency Across Platforms
Built to scale efficiently from powerful TPU v5p clusters to Android devices, using Google's custom hardware and software stack.
