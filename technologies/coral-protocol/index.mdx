# Coral Protocol

Coral Protocol is an open, decentralized infrastructure enabling AI agents to communicate, coordinate, and transact securely. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it facilitates the development of interoperable multi-agent systems, fostering the emergence of the "Internet of Agents."

Designed to be modular, trustless, and scalable, Coral Protocol enables intelligent agents—LLMs, bots, or autonomous scripts—to advertise capabilities, initiate tasks, and collaborate via structured message exchanges. The system integrates decentralized identity, on-chain micropayments using the $CORAL token, and a memory-augmented communication framework to support both composable pipelines and dynamic task execution. Its architecture empowers developers to build robust agent ecosystems that are open, interoperable, and economically sustainable.
