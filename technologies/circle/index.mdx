## Core Infrastructure

### **USDC Stablecoin**
- Fully backed by cash and short-dated U.S. Treasuries, redeemable 1:1 for USD.  
- Managed under a transparent reserve model, with **monthly attestations** and **regulated custody partners**.  
- Deployed across major networks â€” Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Base, and more â€” enabling native, multi-chain interoperability.  
- Forms the **liquidity backbone** of Circleâ€™s payment, wallet, and settlement products.

### **Programmable Money Platform**
- Circleâ€™s APIs abstract away blockchain complexity for enterprises and developers.  
- Tools for creating wallets, processing payments, and building real-time financial applications.  
- Integrated compliance, KYC/AML, and treasury management layers for enterprise-grade operations.

### **Cross-Chain Interoperability**
- Circleâ€™s **Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)** allows native USDC movement across networks without wrapping.  
- Streamlines liquidity, supports modular composability, and reduces settlement risk across ecosystems.
