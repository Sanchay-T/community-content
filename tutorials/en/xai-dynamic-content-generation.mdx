# **Dynamic Content Generation with xAI: Blog Writing and Summarization**

Hey there! It‚Äôs Tommy again, and I‚Äôm excited to walk you through building something amazing today. In this tutorial, we‚Äôre diving into the world of AI-powered content generation by creating a dynamic content generation tool powered by **xAI‚Äôs Grok API**. The result? A streamlined system where you can generate SEO-friendly blogs, article summaries, or product descriptions in various tones and styles‚Äîcompletely AI-driven.

With the Grok API handling the content generation and Streamlit providing an intuitive interface, you‚Äôll see how easy it is to bring your creative ideas to life. Whether you‚Äôre a writer, a marketer, or just someone curious about the capabilities of AI in content creation, this tutorial is tailored for you.

Let‚Äôs get started and revolutionize your content creation process! üöÄ

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To ensure all the features work seamlessly, it‚Äôs essential to configure your development environment correctly.

### Conda Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate a new Conda environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create -n content_generator python=3.11 -y
   conda activate content_generator
   ```

2. **Find Your Environment Path**:  
   To find the full path to your Conda environment‚Äôs pip, Python interpreter, or any other executable, use the `which` command:

   ```bash
   which python
   ```

   This command outputs the full path to your Python interpreter. For example, on macOS, you might see:

   ```bash
   /opt/anaconda3/envs/content_generator/bin/python
   ```

   Similarly, you can use:

   ```bash
   which pip
   ```

   Or

   ```bash
   which streamlit
   ```

   Use these paths to run commands if needed.

3. **Install Required Packages**:  
   Using the full path to your pip (if necessary), install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   /opt/anaconda3/envs/content_generator/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, if your environment is already activated, you can use:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the `.env` File**:  
    Create a `.env` file to securely store your API key:
   `bash
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
`

### Configuring VSCode

To work efficiently in VSCode, set the Python interpreter to use your activated Conda environment:

1. Press **`Ctrl + Shift + P`** (or **`Cmd + Shift + P`** on macOS).
2. Select **`Python: Select Interpreter`**.
3. Choose your Conda environment (content_generator).

## Building the Application

The project consists of three Python files:

- `content_generator.py`: Handles interaction with the xAI Grok API.
- `utils.py`: Contains helper functions, like saving generated content to a file.
- `main.py`: The entry point for the Streamlit-based UI.

### File 1: `content_generator.py`

This file is the backbone of the application, responsible for interfacing with xAI‚Äôs Grok API. The `generate_content` function sends a prompt along with parameters like tone, creativity (temperature), and maximum token length to the API. It then retrieves and formats the generated content for further use.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
from textwrap import dedent
import os


load_dotenv()


# Configure the OpenAI client for xAI's Grok API
api_key = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(
   api_key=api_key,
   base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)


def generate_content(prompt: str, tone="professional", temperature=0.7, max_tokens=500) -> str:
   """
   Generate dynamic content using the xAI Grok API.


   Parameters:
       prompt (str): The input text to guide the content generation.
       model (str): The Grok model to use (default: "grok-beta").
       tone (str): Desired tone (e.g., "professional", "casual", "persuasive").
       temperature (float): Creativity level (0.0 to 1.0).
       max_tokens (int): Maximum length of the generated text.


   Returns:
       str: Generated content.
   """
   formatted_prompt = dedent(f""" \
       Based on the promt below generate dynamic content, let it be in the tone specified
       and optimize the content for SEO using the keywords if specified.
       Prompt: {prompt}
       Tone: {tone}


       """)

   try:
       response = client.chat.completions.create(
           model="grok-beta",
           messages=[
               {"role": "system", "content": "You are an experienced content writer."},
               {"role": "user", "content": formatted_prompt},
           ],
           temperature=temperature,
           max_tokens=max_tokens,
           n=1
       )
       return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
   except Exception as e:
       return f"Error: {e}"
```

### File 2: `utils.py`

This utility script provides the `save_to_file` function, which allows you to save the generated content to a local file. This feature is especially helpful when you want to preserve your content for later use or publishing.

```python
def save_to_file(content, filename="generated_content.txt"):
   """
   Save content to a text file.


   Parameters:
       content (str): The content to save.
       filename (str): The name of the file.


   Returns:
       str: Confirmation message with the file path.
   """
   try:
       with open(filename, "w") as file:
           file.write(content)
       return f"Content successfully saved to {filename}"
   except Exception as e:
       return f"Error saving content: {e}"

```

### File 3: `main.py`

This file is the entry point for the application, creating a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. It gathers user inputs like the content prompt, tone, temperature, and SEO keywords, then calls the `generate_content` function to produce the output. Users can view, modify, and save the generated content directly through the interface.

```python
import streamlit as st
from utils import save_to_file
from content_generator import generate_content


# Streamlit app
st.title("xAI Dynamic Content Generator")


# User inputs
st.header("üìù Enter Content Details")
prompt = st.text_area("Enter a topic or description", "")
tone = st.selectbox("Select a tone", ["Professional", "Casual", "Persuasive"])
temperature = st.slider("Creativity Level (Temperature)", 0.0, 1.0, 0.7)
max_tokens = st.number_input("Max Tokens", min_value=100, max_value=1000, value=500)


# SEO Optimization Section
st.header("üîç SEO Optimization")
keywords = st.text_input(
   "Add keywords for SEO (comma-separated)",
   placeholder="e.g., AI tools, productivity, machine learning"
)


if st.button("Generate Content"):
   if not prompt:
       st.error("Please enter a topic or description!")
   else:
       # Append keywords to the prompt for SEO
       if keywords:
           seo_prompt = f"{prompt}\n\nInclude the following keywords: {keywords}."
       else:
           seo_prompt = prompt


       # Generate content
       with st.spinner("Generating content..."):
           content = generate_content(seo_prompt, tone=tone, temperature=temperature, max_tokens=max_tokens)
       if content:
           st.success("Content generated successfully!")
           st.header("Generated Content")
           # Display generated content in Markdown format
           st.markdown(content, unsafe_allow_html=True)


           # Save content to file
           if st.button("Save to File"):
               message = save_to_file(content)
               st.info(message)
       else:
           st.error("Failed to generate content. Please try again.")


# Footer
st.sidebar.info("üí° Pro Tip: Use relevant keywords to boost SEO performance!")
```
